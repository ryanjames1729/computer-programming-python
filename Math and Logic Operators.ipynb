    "# Math and Logic Operators\n",
    "In Python, as well as other langauges, there are different reserved symbols for the math and logic operator to change the variable assignment of a program. These operators are essential to any program using math and/or logic which will encompass many or your programs. When trying to debug a program, make sure that you pay attention to the math and logic in the program and you may need to keep this page of your notebook handy at the beginning when still trying to step through your errors.\n",

    "### Math Operators\n",
    "There are a lot of math operations that can be accomplished using Python. Actually, that's one reason for its recent rise in programming. With the need for ML and AI applications, Python has been a goto language for many people due to its ease of use in creating solutions which require a heavy amount of mathematical calculation. Through this, you'll learn that there are math operators and math functions from the math class. These are 2 different things and you should be aware of those differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The math operators in Python that you should be aware of are:\n",
    "- ```a + b``` : addition of two numbers\n",
    "- ```a - b``` : subtraction of two numbers\n",
    "- ```a * b``` : multiplication of two numbers\n",
    "- ```a / b``` : division of two numbers, decimals are kept\n",
    "- ```a % b``` : modulus division of two numbers, returns the remainder\n",
    "- ```a ** b``` : exponents in the format $a^b$\n",
    "- ```a // b``` : division of two numbers, throws away the decimal for ints"

In mathematics, an even number can be created by multiplying any number by 2 - so therefore every even number is divisible by 2. When a number is divisible by 2 that means that its remainder by dividing by 2 will always be zero. \n"

    "Well that was fun, but time to change directions a bit. Another way of using Python to make math calcuations is to use the math class that is in Python. It is not realistic for you to know every math operation but you are going to be exposed to a few of the operations. A full list of the math operations can be found in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html). Here is a brief list of some of the highlights:\n",
    "- ```math.fabs()```        Returns the absolute value\n",
    "- ```math.factorial()```   Returns the factorial\n",
    "- ```math.log()```         Returns the log, base can be specified\n",
    "- ```math.exp()```         Returns the exponential, base and power\n",
    "- ```math.sqrt()```        Returns the square root\n",

    "### Logic Operators\n",
    "In addition to using the various math operators that are above, a program's complexity and flexibility can be enhanced by using logic operators. Logic operators refer to the commands in a program that allow for decision making to happen. A logic statement in programming will only evaluate to ```True``` or ```False```. In programming, there are 5 operators that used to test for the comparison of numbers:\n",
    "- ```a < b```    Is a less than b?\n",
    "- ```a <= b```   Is a less than or equal to b?\n",
    "- ```a > b```    Is a greater than b?\n",
    "- ```a >= b```   Is a greater than or equal to b?\n",
    "- ```a == b```   Is a equal to b?\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this, there are 3 more operators that can change the logic of a statement:\n",
    "- ```not a```   Flips the value of a\n",
    "- ```a and b``` Returns True if a and b are both True and False otherwise\n",
    "- ```a or b```  Returns True if either a or b are True and False if both are False\n",
