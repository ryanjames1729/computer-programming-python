    "#Selection Statements with If, Else, and Elif\n",
    "In programming, the concept of a selection statement is very common so it is very important to understanding how to read and how to write selection statements. There are a few different types of selections statements that you will need to know how to use:\n",
    "-`if`\n",
    "-`else`\n",
    "-`elif` (also known as else if)\n",
    "\n",
    "With each of these selection statements the program flow can be changed when the user of the program enters data into the program. It will make a program more dynamic and so that specific outcomes of the program do not have to be 'hard coded' for it to run smoothly and correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Using the `if` Keyword\n",
    "In Python, like most languages, the if is used. The statement looks at the Boolean statement following the keyword and determines if it is True or False. If it is True, then the rest of the code runs. If not, it will simply skip over the rest of the statement. You can always tell what is part of the if by looking at the tabbing. The 'inside' of the if statement is always tabbed over.\n"

The second one with the `and` statement tries to determine if the number is both positive and even.

How do you keep from having syntax or logic errors? Ok, so there' a lot in there. Looking at the block of code that was just used, there are 5 lines of code with the variable declaration on Line 1. Lines 2 and 4 are 'linked' because they are both aligned with each other and there are no other statements that are in between them. Lines 2 and 3 really act as one statement and Lines 4 and 5 really act as a second statement. \n"

Lines 4 and 5 contain the second `if` statement which is 'linked' with the `else` statement that is contained in Lines 6 and 7. Now the problem is, how is this resolved?\n",

The else statement will execute whenever the if statement above it does not execute due to it's condition being False. There is a way to create a condition for the else though, and that's to use an elif statement. The keyword elif is short for 'else if'.\n"

    "In the example shown above, the entire statement acts as one decision making statement. Since the middle statement is an elif statement, it will tie together the if statement at the top and the else statement at the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the `elif`, this will make it so that only 1 statement will execute. Looking at the previous example, there are 3 statements. First there is the `if` statement that is contained on Lines 2 and 3. Then there is the second statement with the `elif` on likes 4 and 5. The third statement is on Lines 6 and 7. When the `elif` connects it all together, Lines 2 - 7 will act as one decision making block where only 1 thing will ever print. The value for `num` can be changed to anything and still only 1 print statement wille execute. The beauty of using the `elif` command is that there is no limit to using it. The `elif` can be used multiple times. The example below is trivial but just to show how it can be used over and over again."
