    "Python is a text-based programming language that has been around since 1991. It has gone through several versions and updates and is currently on Python 3.8.5. With Python, just about any solution that requires programming can be found from creating games, scraping websites, machine learning algorithms, and building full-stack websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to create and run Python programs. Python programs are always saved with a .py extension. Here are a few ways of creating and running python programs in no particular order:\n",
    "- download IDLE from [Python](https://python.org/)\n",
    "- download [Atom](https://atom.io/) from GitHub \n",
    "- download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) from Microsoft \n",
    "- use [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) online \n",
