    "\n",

    "Something that you may not have noticed when working through that example is that Python does not care what type of information you store into a variable. You can swap the information of **a** and **b** even though they are different types of numbers. One of these numbers has a decimal and one does not, so that means that one of these numbers will have more information to store than the other number. \n",

    "### Data Types\n",
    "In programming there are common data types throughout and each programming language deals with these data types in different ways. For this course, you are learning how to create and use the data types using the Python programming language. This may change when you work with languages like JavaScript, Java, or C++.\n",

    "The following data types are the ones that you will be using in this course and in Python, they are referred to as primitive data types.\n",

    "- float which is short for floating type\n",
    "- String \n",
    "- Boolean which is either ```True``` or ```False```\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, the data type concept may seem trivial since Python abstracts this to a certain degree with variable assignment. The problem with data types happens when writing a code segment that combines the information from more than 1 type of data type. Let's look at an example that doesn't have any problems and then one that does have a problem.\n"

    "\n",
    "Probaby the most common data type issue will pop up when combining a String literal with another data type. The reason this happens is because when the code runs and it sees the addition symbol trying to combine different types of data it cannot figure out if you were asking it to sum up the information mathematically or if you were asking it to concatenate the information like creating a phrase or sentence. When dealing with this, there are 2 solutions that are equally correct.\n",
    "1. Cast (or change) the data type to a String using the ```str()`` function. Every data type has a function that you can cast one data type to that one. ```date = str(13)``` will cast the number 13 to the String literal \"13\".\n",
    "2. Use the enhanced formatting for Strings where the syntax is ```\"{}\".format(data)```. So its usage could be ```\"Y2K was about the year {}.\".format(2000)``` That will create the String literal \"Y2K was about the year 2000.\" \n"
